## Background

**Plague** represents a newly identified **Linux backdoor** that has quietly evaded detection by traditional antivirus solutions for **over a year**.  
Its primary mechanism involves operating as a **malicious PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module)**, allowing attackers to silently bypass system authentication and establish persistent SSH access to compromised Linux systems.

---

### Infection

- Plague’s initial infection vector remains **unknown**.  
  However, during deployment, the malware drops a **binary** configured to run as a **PAM module for `sshd`**.
- This module provides an **SSH backdoor**, enabling threat actors to log in to the infected machine **without standard authentication**.
- Because it operates within the **core of Linux authentication**, the malware can **persist through application updates and security patches**.

---

### Summary

Plague’s deep integration with PAM makes it particularly stealthy and durable.  
Its ability to bypass authentication and persist across updates highlights the importance of **PAM auditing** and **system integrity monitoring** in Linux environments.
